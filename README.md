# MooMooT : Modular audio synthesis in Rust

[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/flo-dhalluin/moomoot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flo-dhalluin/moomoot)

MooMooT aims at being an attempt at being a software modular synthesizer, similar to [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), or [PureData](http://puredata.info/), but written in Rust.

MooMooT handles the realtime audio generation, and will provide the foundation for an interactive / livecoding music generation, probably via a OSC and a higher level language (due to Rust lacking a REPL system)

## In a nutshell/concepts

MooMooT uses [JACK](http://jackaudio.org) for sound output, so you obviously first need to run jack.

- sounds is generated by a tree of "Mixers",
- the leaves of the Tree are populated by unit "Synths" object ( think basic waveform generators )
- each Mixer node sums all the attached synths and sub-mixers and has a stack of effects associated.
- you can add nodes in realtime via the API
- each Synth or Effect has parameters that could be changed in realtime via a parameter bus ( think modifying the phase, or cut-off frequency of filter)

## Plans

- Macros (to create instruments including subtree)
- Stereophonics ! 
- include a OSC server binary

## Licensing

3-Clauses BSD
